<!-- Cool! Look at me! This is an HTML file. It describes what each page contains in a format your browser can understand. -->
<!-- The first part of the flag (there are 3 parts) is 72b28b258d2 -->
<!-- What other types of files are there in a webpage? -->

There's part of a flag in the html comments. There are href and src files linked to this page. We can further use curl or browse manually.

If the files contain the word "flag" we can pipe the results of the curl command into the grep command:

gbw@grnbeltwarrior:~/PicoCTF_2017$ curl -L shell2017.picoctf.com:4443/script.js | grep flag
